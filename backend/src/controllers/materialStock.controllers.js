/**
 * GET /material-stock
 * Query params (all optional, partial/case-insensitive match):
 *   itemCodePdm, style, color, model, season, buyer, invoiceNo, item,
 *   warehouse, location, supplier, fabricDetails
 *
 * Date range (optional, inclusive, matched against the parent Receive's
 * Date, format "YYYY-MM-DD" so plain string comparison sorts correctly):
 *   dateFrom, dateTo
 *
 * Reads from the rack allocations table (material_receive_item_locations),
 * NOT the batch table — so every row here is one Date + Item Code/PDM +
 * Color + Rack combination. A batch split across two racks now shows as
 * two rows, each with its own Roll/Yds and Available Roll/Yds, which is
 * exactly "which rack has how many rolls, and how many are still
 * available". Ordered oldest Receive Date first (FIFO). A "summary" array
 * gives Total Available Roll/Yds per Item Code/PDM + Color across ALL its
 * racks combined, for the headline "Total Available" figure.
 *
 * Supplier (invoice/parent-level) and Fabric Details (item/batch-level) are
 * both included in every row and are filterable the same way as the other
 * fields, so the frontend can search/display them without changing what
 * columns show by default.
 *
 * AGEING: every row also gets `ageDays` (days since its Receive Date) and
 * `ageBucket` (one of AGE_BUCKET_ORDER above). An `ageingSummary` array is
 * returned too — one entry per bucket (always all five, even if empty),
 * with batchCount / totalAvailableRoll / totalAvailableYds aggregated
 * ONLY over rows that still have stock (hasStock === true). Zero/negative
 * rows are excluded from ageing since "how old is stock that isn't there
 * anymore" isn't a meaningful ageing signal — they still show up in `rows`
 * as always, just not counted here.
 *
 * VISIBILITY POLICY: this endpoint used to hide any rack allocation with
 * availableRoll <= 0 AND availableYds <= 0, on the theory that "0 stock
 * isn't really stock". That silently hid rows that DO exist in the DB --
 * including legacy-import rows where the sheet's INHAND value was
 * genuinely 0, or even NEGATIVE (accounting-format cells like "(40)",
 * meaning -40, which happens when a sheet records more issued than was
 * ever received). Since the whole import pipeline's rule is "whatever's
 * in the sheet is exactly what lands in DB and stays visible", that
 * filter contradicted the data it was hiding. It has been removed --
 * EVERY rack allocation row now always shows up here, exactly as stored.
 * A `hasStock` boolean is added to each row (true only when
 * availableRoll > 0 OR availableYds > 0) so the frontend can badge
 * zero/negative rows distinctly (e.g. "No stock" / "Adjustment") instead
 * of presenting them as normal available inventory.
