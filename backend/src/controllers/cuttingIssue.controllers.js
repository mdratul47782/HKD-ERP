// backend/src/controllers/cuttingIssue.controllers.js

//
// Used by the MATERIAL WAREHOUSE side page (Material-warehouse -> Cutting
// Issue). Shows incoming Requisitions from Cutting as notifications
// (bell icon, read/unread), lets the warehouse user issue stock against
// them from a specific rack (decrementing the SAME
// material_receive_item_locations.availableRoll/Yds that Material Stock
// reads from), and keeps a History ledger of every issue action.
//
// Cutting requisition items no longer carry a "requested Roll" (Roll is a
// Material Warehouse-only decision, made freely at issue time based on
// what's actually on the shelf) and there is NO hard cap stopping the
// warehouse from issuing more Yds than was requested -- Cutting's
// Consumption-based estimate can be off, and the warehouse is trusted to
// judge that on the floor. The frontend shows a confirmation prompt when
// an issue would exceed the requested Yds; the backend only guards against
// issuing more than a rack physically has available.
//
// UPDATE 3: Roll and Yds no longer both have to be > 0 to issue. Some
// racks are tracked by Yds only, some by Roll only -- the warehouse user
// can now leave EITHER one at 0 (e.g. Roll=0, Yds=50, or Roll=50, Yds=0)
// and the row still goes through. Only BOTH being 0 (or missing) is
// rejected, since that isn't an issue action at all.
//
// UPDATE 4: Issuing now only requires an ITEM CODE/PDM match between the
// requisition item and the rack being issued from -- Color is
// intentionally NOT checked anymore. A rack holding a different Color of
// the same Item Code/PDM can be issued against a requisition item that
// asked for a different Color. (The frontend's "Check stock" panel also
// no longer filters by Color for this reason -- it shows every Color for
// the requested Item Code/PDM, visually flagging Color/Season mismatches,
// and lets the user pick freely.)
//
// UPDATE 5 (bugfix): the Item Code/PDM match check used to be a plain
// `batch.itemCodePdm !== reqItem.itemCodePdm` strict string compare. Real
// data can have identical-looking codes that differ only by leading/
// trailing whitespace or letter case (e.g. "4137688 " vs "4137688", or
// "ABC123" vs "abc123") -- these are the SAME item code for all practical
// purposes but fail a strict `!==` check, incorrectly blocking a valid
// issue with "Selected rack does not hold this Item Code/PDM" even though
// both rows visibly show the same code on screen. The match is now done
// via `normalizeCode()` (trim + lowercase) on both sides, same normalization
// style already used for search/filter matching in
// materialStock.controllers.js.
